Online Learning Toolkit

Is a collection of a few scripts you can use, to do online learning.
The first script allows you to organize a peer feedback exercise easily.

To run postgres use:

postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres

# TODO: Rename peer_review_... models
# TODO: Allow to actually give feedback, view is blocking this
# TODO; Reviews should be enabled, as soon as mails go out, not as due date arrives, on an individual basis
# TODO: Safer URLs for students and teachers with some kind of token
# TODO: Check if we still need any of the public/javascripts
